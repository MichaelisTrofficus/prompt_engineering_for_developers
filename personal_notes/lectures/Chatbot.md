Overall, building a custom **chatbot** using a large language model like **GPT-3** can be a powerful tool for businesses and developers. 

With just a modest amount of effort, you can create a chatbot that can act as an AI customer service agent or an AI order taker for a restaurant. By understanding the OpenAI chat completions format and using helper functions to collect user prompts and assistant responses, you can create a conversational interface that can handle multi-turn conversations and single-turn tasks. 

**With a little creativity and customization, the possibilities for chatbot applications are endless.**
