The lecture discusses the task of **expanding a shorter piece of text into a longer one** using a [[LLM]]. While this can be useful for brainstorming, it can also lead to problematic use cases **such as generating spam**. Therefore, it is important to use this capability responsibly and in a way that helps people. 

The following code snippet provides an example of how to use a language model to generate a personalized email based on customer reviews and sentiment. It is important to be transparent with users that the text they are seeing was generated by AI. 

```python
# review for a blender

review = f"""
So, they still had the 17 piece system on seasonal \
sale for around $49 in the month of November, about \
half off, but for some reason (call it price gouging) \
around the second week of December the prices all went \
up to about anywhere from between $70-$89 for the same \
system. And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \
so in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \
So it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \
where the blade locks into place doesnâ€™t look as good \
as in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \
plan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \
very hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \ 
blender first then pulverize them in the serving size \
I want in the blender then switch to the whipping \
blade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \
first when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \
if I need them finer/less pulpy). Special tip when making \
smoothies, finely cut and freeze the fruits and \
vegetables (if using spinach-lightly stew soften the \ 
spinach then freeze until ready for use-and if making \
sorbet, use a small to medium sized food processor) \ 
that you plan to use that way you can avoid adding so \
much ice if at all-when making your smoothie. \
After about a year, the motor was making a funny noise. \
I called customer service but the warranty expired \
already, so I had to buy another one. FYI: The overall \
quality has gone done in these types of products, so \
they are kind of counting on brand recognition and \
consumer loyalty to maintain sales. Got it in about \
two days.

This lesson  also introduces the concept of **temperature** as a parameter of the language model that allows for varying degrees of exploration and randomness in the model's responses. A higher temperature leads to more random outputs, while a temperature of zero leads to more predictable responses.  It is recommended to use a temperature of zero for building applications where a predictable response is desired, and higher temperatures for more creative applications.

For example, let's see the output of the previous model using a higher temperature. **If we run the cell twice, we'll get different results (due to the randomness introduce by higher temperatures).**
