A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence algorithm that uses Deep Learning  techniques and massively large data sets to **understand, summarize, generate and predict new content**. The term Generative AI also is closely connected with LLMs, which are, in fact, a type of generative AI that has been specifically architected to help generate text-based content.

LLMs take a complex approach that involves multiple components.

At the foundational layer, an LLM needs to be trained on a large volume -- sometimes referred to as a _corpus_ -- of data that is typically petabytes in size. The training can take multiple steps, usually starting with an **unsupervised learning** approach. In that approach, the model is trained on **unstructured data** and unlabeled data. The benefit of training on unlabeled data is that there is often vastly more data available. **At this stage, the model begins to derive relationships between different words and concepts.**

The next step for some LLMs is training and fine-tuning with a form of self-supervised learning. Here, some **data labelling** has occurred, assisting the model to more accurately identify different concepts.

Next, the LLM undertakes Deep Learning as it goes through the transformer neural network process. The transformer architecture enables the LLM to understand and recognize the relationships and connections between words and concepts using a **self-attention mechanism**. That mechanism is able to assign a score, commonly referred to as a _weight_, to a given item (called a _token_) in order to determine the relationship.

Once an LLM has been trained, a base exists on which the AI can be used for practical purposes. By querying the LLM with a prompt, the AI model inference can generate a response, which could be an answer to a question, newly generated text, summarized text or a  sentiment analysis.
